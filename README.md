# Hausdorff
## In Progress
- updated naming in Hausdorff.lean (note some names are very outdated and may not align with the
    objects they represent)
- potentially reducing logical redundancty between Two_iso_helper and iso_of_sigma_partition

## Complete
- updated all files **except** Hausdorff.lean to comply with the style guide
- Scattered order definition changed to rational embedding definition
- Proofs throughout modified to rely only on embedding definition of scattered
- Completed documentation throughout all files
